  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:43 - No license file was found in the standard Xilinx license
directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - Since no license file was found,
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Timing:3159 - The DCM, variable_freq_clk_generator_inst/DCM_CLKGEN_1, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to
   PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these
   clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing
   constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE
   (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays
   alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the
   environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE,
   consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
2368 block(s) removed
2158 block(s) optimized away
3418 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

INFO:Timing:3386 - Intersecting Constraints found and resolved.  For more 
   information, see the TSI report.  Please consult the Xilinx Command Line 
   Tools User Guide for information on generating a TSI report.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 10

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
